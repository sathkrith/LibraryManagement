abstract:Do you want to become more confident handling an oil brush? How about developing your skill in manipulating and mixing oil colors? This volume, filled with the experience and techniques of ten of today's finest oil painters, shows you how to discover and paint your own successful paintings, covering everything from the importance of brush selection to capturing the color nuances of a collapsing wave. Together these artists offer a treasury of instruction in oil technique: Charles Reid shows you how to handle an oil brush with dexterity and how to make handling and mixing color simple. Wendon Blake, George Cherepov, Paul Strisik, and Richard Schmid teach you how to capture the magnificence of a full landscape, and the more subtle characteristics of the countryside; Foster Caddell shows you how to overcome elementary errors in composition, balance of values and especially how to handle color in the landscape; E. John Robinson demonstrates how to capture the color and awesome power in the sea and shore; Ken Davies teaches you how to render sharp focus still lifes in oil; and John Howard Sanden, Charles Pfahl and Jane Corsellis show you how to paint the human portrait and figure, perhaps the most intriguing painting subject of all. The book is divided into seven sections: oil Brushwork, handling color, landscapes, color in landscapes, seascapes, sharp focus, and figures and portraits. Each section's full-color step-by-step demonstrations clearly illustrate how the artists achieve their striking results, and how you can too. Profusely illustrated and entirely in color, Oil Painting Techniques is required reading for the amateur or intermediate oil painter who wants to develop his skill in this medium.
