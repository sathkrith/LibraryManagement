title:Life is Elsewhere
category:Fiction
abstract:Out of print since 1987, "Life Is Elsewhere" is available again in an outstanding new translation. Kundera's epic of adolescence tenderly erodes such sacrosanct values as childhood, motherhood, revolution, and even poetry, in a "remarkable portrait of an artist as a young man" ("Newsweek").
