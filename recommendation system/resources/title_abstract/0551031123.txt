title:Why I Follow Jesus
category:Religion
abstract:From the perennially popular Adrian Plass, this book sets down his personal thoughts on Christianity Adrian Plass's popularity is often put down to his refreshingly honest insight into what it means to be a Christian in today's world. This is what makes him such a sought-after speaker around the world. Why I follow Jesus will be an attempt by Adrian to explain why it is that a man who lived 2000 years ago and who lived for such a short time, still has meaning for someone like himself today. Why it is that he feels compelled to spend his life following the example of Jesus and trying to tell others what it means to be a follower of God.
