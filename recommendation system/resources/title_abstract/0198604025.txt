abstract:Renamed How Not To Say What You Mean, this brand new edition of A Dictionary of Euphemisms is packed full of the old favourites, such as 'early bath' or 'push up the daisies', as well as euphemisms from modern times, like 'human sacrifice', 'coffee-housing', and 'tuft-hunter'. Definitions include examples from real authors, along with historical explanations of origins, and now obsolete euphemisms like 'leaping house', 'nightingale' are signposted as such. And to prove that the use of euphemisms is not just a British speciality, there is widespread coverage of American euphemisms too: 'English' (pertaining to sexual deviance), 'watermelon' (an indication of pregnancy). Reviews for previous editions: 'This ingenious collection is not only very funny but extremely instructive too' Iris Murdoch 'Many printable gems' Daily Telegraph 'An informative, amusing collection' Observer 'Hugely enjoyable and cherishable' Times Educational Supplement 'This (excellent) book is your complete guide to every euphemism you could ever want to know and many you would rather not' Daily Mail
