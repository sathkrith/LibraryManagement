title:The Sacred Diary of Adrian Plass
category:Christian fiction
abstract:This is the book that all Adrian Plass fans have been waiting for--the sequel to the book that launched him as the UK's best-selling Christian author. Ten years later, what has become of the outrageous Gerald, the joyless Flushpools, the incompetent Leonard, the longsuffering Anne and all the other characters that became household names in the Christian market? If they have changed, so too has the world in which they live and the church to which they belong. Ever anxious to keep in step with the Holy Spirit, their enthusiasm frequently lands them in trouble of various kinds, and, as ever, they find it hard to accept the simplest truth of all--that they are loved just for who they are. While Adrian, to his great surprise, finds himself as a sought after Christian speaker and the harder he tries to be serious, the more his audiences laugh!
