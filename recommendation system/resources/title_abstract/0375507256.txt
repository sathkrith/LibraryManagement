title:Cloud Atlas: A Novel
category:Fate and fatalism
abstract:An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution. The story is a time-shifting weave of six interlinking narratives, with diverse settings from the savagery of a Pacific island in the 1850s to a dystopian Korea of the near future.
