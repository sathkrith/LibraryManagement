title:Rosie's Walk
category:Juvenile Fiction
abstract:Rosie the hen leaves the chicken coop and sets out for a little walk. Right behind her is the fox, slyly trying to catch up with her. Rosie's walk is quiet, uneventful and eventually leads her back to the coop, blissfully unaware of the fox's travails as he tries -- unsuccessfully -- to navigate the obstacle course that Rosie has led him through.
