title:Changer
category:Fiction
abstract:Wild and unpredictable, brother to the sea, older than the creatures that walk the earth or swim in her waters, the Changer delights in countless shapes. When someone attempts to wipe out his family, the Changer discards coyote form and descends from the wilderness to call in a few favors from none other than King Arthur himself. But Arthur has problems of his own. The Lustrum Review is about to meet and the tenuous accord that holds the athanor community in loose alliance is being challenged. Some of the challengers merely desire to see a few restrictions dropped. Others wish to see the Accord destroyed – and if Arthur and his closest allies are destroyed with it, they would be delighted. For Arthur, the Changer’s arrival, ominous as it may be could also be a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate how the Accord serves even the most ancient among their immortal community. He also hopes that their alliance will serve to anchor this wild one more firmly to his cause. Yet nothing is ever that simple. Before the Changer takes his revenge, those who have called themselves gods and have been the root of many a heroic legend will find themselves threatened with destruction. The very earth itself will shake. And a coyote pup―sole survivor of the Changer’s murdered family―will discover both her weakness and her hidden strength. New to this edition of Changer―special introduction by the author!
