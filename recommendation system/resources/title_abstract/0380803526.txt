title:The Renegades: Cole
category:Fiction
abstract:The Renegade Cole McCord, the most dangerous man in Colorado, is a hired gun with a hardened heart. No man will ever claim his loyalty again...and no woman will ever win his love. So when he accepts headstrong Aurora Benton's offer to be her bodyguard on a treacherous cattle drive he tells her it's strictly business, but finds himself drawn against his will to this all-to-desirable temptress. The Woman Eastern born and bred, Aurora has never met anyone like the half-Chickasaw she's just hired. He's nothing like the lackluster Milquetoasts who've offered for her hand, and he awakens in her unbidden desires. Determined to make it to Texas to start a new life, Aurora knew from the start that she'd have to face drought, outlaws and a long, hard trail...but she never expected to face her passion for the one man she can never have.
