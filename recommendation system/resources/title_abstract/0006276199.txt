title:An Alien at St Wilfred's
category:Religion
abstract:Best-selling author Adrian Plass tells the humorous and poignant tale of a small alien who comes to live in a parish church. Reverend David Persimmon did not enjoy his first three years at St Wilfred's. His sermons were a weekly nightmare. But everything changed the day a small alien appeared in the church building and decided on making his home there. Adrian Plass tells his unusual story in his inimitable blend of humour and penetrating comment. It is only through the untutored eyes of an alien being that life at St Wilfred's is seen for what it really is.
