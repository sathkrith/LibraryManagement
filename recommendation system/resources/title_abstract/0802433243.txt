abstract:Only the Wind Remembers is based on the true story of Ishi, the last surviving Yahi Indian, who emerged alone from the California wilderness in 1911 and was thrust into the bewildering world of San Francisco society. Allison Morgan, an assistant curator at the museum where Ishi is put on display, quickly forms a deep friendship with this 'Stone Age' man. Abandoned in an alley as a child and unable to open herself up even to her husband, Allison can identify with Ishi's loneliness and fear. But the secret fable Ishi begins telling her gives Allison hope that things can be different. Will Ishi die before he can reveal to Allison the truth she was destined to hear?
