title:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass
category:Fiction
abstract:The two Alice books--Lewis Carroll's masterpieces--are ranked by many as peers of the great adult works of English literature. And despite their riches of "untranslatable" puns, nonsense, and parody, they have been happily translated around the world. The matchless original illustrations by Tenniel share with Carroll's text the glory of making Alice immortal.
