title:The Practice of Prayer
category:Religion
abstract:Following in the footsteps of the two earlier teaching series of the 1950s and 1970s, these volumes seek to reveal the distinctive vision Anglicanism offers for the people of God today. Each book includes a study guide and a list of additional resources. The series is designed for wide parish use, including adult education, classes for inquirers and newcomers, the adult catechumenate, parish libraries, and study groups throughout the church year.In this down-to-earth book on the essentials of prayer, Guenther answers many of the most common questions about prayer and the spiritual life. She also discusses basic matters of Christian practice, such as making a confession, going on retreat, using a journal to pray, finding a spiritual director, and praying when God does not seem to listen.
