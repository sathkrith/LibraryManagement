title:Father McBride's Family Catechism
category:Religion
abstract:Following the structure of the official Catechism, this new look at timeless teachings is intended to help families implement the teachings of the Catechism into their everyday family lives. Each section begins with reference numbers to the Catechism itself and an entertaining yet thought-provoking opening story, followed by a Catechism reflection, an application of the teaching to Catholic family life, a family prayer, and finally, a glossary of technical terms. An ideal way to stimulate reading of the Catechism as well as bring the teachings of the Faith home.
