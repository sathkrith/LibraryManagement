title:Rachel's Tears
category:Biography & Autobiography
abstract:Rachel Scott was a typical teenage girl who was incredibly dedicated to following and serving Christ. Though she was mocked for her beliefs, at times doubted her faith, and constantly struggled with personal issues every teenager faces, she remained faithful to God. Then on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School, she was killed for that faith. Rachel's Tears is a moving meditation on the life, death, and faith of Rachel as seen through the eyes of her parents and through writings and drawings from her journals. Her parents also offer a spiritual perspective on the Columbine tragedy and provide a vision of hope for preventing youth violence across the nation.
