title:In Search of America
category:History
abstract:eter Jennings and Todd Brewster conceived of this fascinating book long before the events of September 11th. But watching America respond to one of the worst attacks in its history deepened the meaning of their project. Now, more than ever, Americans need to treasure their way of life, and to reacquaint themselves with the founding ideas that united and sustained this country in its struggle for independence two hundred and twenty-five years ago. In Search of America explores the basic ideals that drive and define the American character. Exquisitely designed, lavishly illustrated with photographs, and peppered with fascinating sidebars, this superb blend of eyewitness reporting and history is a significant, timely achievement. In Search of America is a splendid and provocative journey, one that will assure each and every American that though the principles of our great nation may be shaken, molded, adapted, and assaulted, remarkably, they endure.
