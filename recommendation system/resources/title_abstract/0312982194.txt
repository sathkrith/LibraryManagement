title:Gettin' Merry
category:Fiction
abstract:Four of today's hottest romance writers invite you to come home for the holidays, where the spicy smells from the kitchen, the warm embrace of family, and the gifts of Kwanzaa are just the beginning of a magical season filled with true love and sensual delights... Be careful what you wish for. That's the lesson a fine brother with a wounded heart learns when an eccentric old woman grants him a wish for true love--if he's not too blind to see it--in Francis Ray's The Wish. Beverly Jenkins spins a soul-touching tale of a soldier reunited with the woman who deserted him as they discover that love isn't just sweeter the second time around, it's downright decadent in Homecoming. In Monica Jackson's The Way Back Home, a biracial young woman sets out to spend Kwanzaa with the African-American family she never knew and finds and extra gift in the strong, loving professor who wants to teacher her about her heritage...and so much more. When a mild-mannered high school principal battles small-town prejudice over a Kwanzaa celebration, he fins an unlikely ally in a fiery woman from his past in Geri Guillaume's moving story, The Seventh Principal. The love of a good man. The hope of a new family. The promise of a fantasy fulfilled. This soulful collection of holiday stories proves there's more than one reason for gettin' merry...and they all lead straight to the heart.
