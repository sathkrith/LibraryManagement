title:Plays by and about Women
category:Drama
abstract:The theater has always been considered a mirror of its time, and many twentieth-century plays have reflected changing views of women. A large number of these, however, have been by men. Here is a volume of eight plays, all written in this century, in which leading women dramatists present their own pictures of their sex. The plays were chosen because they both read and play well and because they deal specifically with women and their problems.
