title:People of the Lie
category:Medical
abstract:With his classic trilogy, The Road Less Traveled, Further Along the Road Less Traveled, and The Road Less Traveled and Beyond, Dr. M. Scott Peck has introduced more than seven million readers to an integration of the deepest insights of psychiatry with those of religion. In this absorbing and equally inspiring companion volume, Dr. Peck brilliantly probes into the essence of human evil. People who are evil attack others instead of facing their own failures. Peck demonstrates the havoc these people of the lie work in the lives of those around them. He presents, from vivid incidents encountered in his psychiatric practice, examples of evil in everyday life. This book is by turns disturbing, fascinating, and altogether impossible to put down as it offers a strikingly original approach to the age-old problem of human evil.
