title:The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby
category:Family & Relationships
abstract:Over 11,000 babies are delivered in the United States every day. Pregnancy, especially when going through it for the first time, can be overwhelming without the Unofficial Guide. Conflicting news reports, jargon-speaking doctors, and a lack of candid information on the nitty-gritty facts on what will happen over the next nine months can get the best of any Mom-to-be. Our author is a fourth-time Mom who's been through it all, and she is able to give expectant mothers the lowdown on choosing among the prenatal care options available; the truth about bodily changes from the perspective of someone who has first-hand experience; and the proper guidance through the maze of procedures, treatments, therapies, and medicines needed to help the reader find out what will work best for her without the wasted time, energy, and money. Thoughtful, authoritative, and unbiased, The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby covers: How to select an obstetrician: Key questions to ask when determining if a doctor is right How to deal with the normal roller-coaster ride of emotion: stress, anxiety, depression Sensible advice on eating for two and the lowdown on vitamin & mineral supplements How to keep informed on risk factors: Cesarean sections, gestational diabetes, hypertension, and more Tips on what to try, what to steer clear of, and how to save time and money without compromising the health of the mother or child
