category:Argentine poetry
abstract:Winner of the Colorado Book Award for Translation upon its release, this book brings to English-speaking audiences new work by this brilliant Argentine poet of whom Octavio Paz says, "Each of Juarroz's poems is a surprising verbal crystallization: language reduced to a drop of light." In Juarroz's work we encounter the vertical depths of language, the inner wells.
