abstract:From the ashram of India's Satya Sai Baba to the Princeton University laboratories of Dr. Robert Jahn, Dr. O'Leary provides firsthand accounts of materializations, controlled experiments in psychokinesis, the mysterious crop circles, and other enigmatic occurrences. A co-founder of the International Association for New Science, he argues for an expanded scientific framework that can encompass this challenging spectrum of phenomena and lead us to new understandings that may solve our most urgent problems.
