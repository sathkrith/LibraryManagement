title:Hitler's Secret Bankers
category:History
abstract:Based on newly declassified documents and archival research, Hitler's Secret Bankers reveals the full, hitherto unknown extent of Swiss economic collaboration with the Nazis during World War II. In this updated edition, readers discover how and why the Swiss finally buckled and agreed to pay $1.25 billion in compensation for the funds deposited by Holocaust victims in Swiss banks. In addition to the dispute over dormant accounts, Swiss banks provided to the Nazi war machine the foreign currency that paid for vital war materiel such as chrome and aluminum. The author also explains how the exposure of the myth of Swiss neutrality, in collaboration with the Nazis, triggered investigations into the role of the British regarding Holocaust victims and the part played by Germany and its failure to compensate the survivors of slave labor, as well as the upheaval in the art world, which failed to restore stolen paintings to their rightful owners.
